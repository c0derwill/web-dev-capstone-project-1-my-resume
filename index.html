    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3 id="work-exp-year">2018 - 2022</h3>
            <p>I worked as a professional Sales Representative and Business Development Manager for some of the leading
                technology companies, which encompassed both front end and back end software. Being in technical conversations and supported
                by our Technical Consultants helped foster my passion for understanding complex technical problems and working to solve them within a team. Although my role was primarily in business, my curiosity helped me to identify
                a few solutions to client problems on the technical side.
            </p>

        <h3 id="work-exp-year">2014 - 2018</h3>
            <p>I worked as a sales representative for an online electricity retailer. I set numerous sales records in this position, including signing the largest contract in the history of the business in 2017. I regularly mentored up and
                coming salespeople, and had a great relationship with the technical team when it came to finding the best arrangements for clients. 
            </p>
        <h3 id="work-exp-year">2010 - 2014</h3>
            <p> I worked for the most successful online business in my country, and was a sales representative for this company. I worked my way up from junior to a senior sales position, and was part of the team that helped
            narrow the national market share in my department.
